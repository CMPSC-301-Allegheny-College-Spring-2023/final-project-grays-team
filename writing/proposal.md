## Proposal Title :

Finding a correlation between a country's GDP per capita and its happiness score. 
How strong is the correlation?

## Questions, Methods, Data and Justification Discussion

For our project, our team is trying to find if there is a correlation between GDP per capita and the happiness index for all of the countries in the world. We wanted to do choose some economic variable and wanted to illustrate how it affects our everyday life.

Our dataset is from kaggle.com and here is the link to it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2023

The dataset contains: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity all quantified. 

We are planning to run a regression using all these variables mentioned above and use the p-values to determine if these variables are good indicators or not. We are also planning to use a couple more different datasets for example: education and healthcare for chosen countries to show specific examples and to compare the data.

Moreover, here are the questions that we have asked from that one dataset, which is linked above:

- Is there a correlation between a country's GDP per capita and its happiness score? If so, how strong is the correlation?

- How have the factors contributing to a country's happiness score changed over time?
Is there a relationship between a country's level of social support and its happiness score? If so, how strong is the relationship?

- How do countries with similar levels of economic development but different cultural backgrounds differ in their happiness scores?

- Are there any regional patterns in the happiness scores of different countries? For example, are countries in certain parts of the world consistently happier than others?
